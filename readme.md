# My Development Environment

In this repository, I share the tools and technologies I use in my development environment. These choices were made based on productivity, ease of configuration, and support for my development stack. Below, I describe the main tools I use:

## Visual Studio Code (VSCode)
Visual Studio Code is a lightweight yet powerful source code editor available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It provides built-in support for JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js and has a rich ecosystem of extensions for other languages and runtimes, such as C++, C#, Java, Python, PHP, Go, and .NET. Its configuration is simple and intuitive, enabling agility in day-to-day work. I highly recommend VSCode for those seeking productivity and efficiency in software development.

## Linux Mint
I use Linux Mint as my primary operating system. Linux Mint is an Irish Linux distribution that comes in two versions: one based on Ubuntu and another based on Debian. I chose Linux Mint for its stability, reliable updates, and active community. Additionally, Linux Mint supports multiple languages, including English, and utilizes the Cinnamon desktop environment, which offers a pleasant and intuitive experience.

## Postman
Postman is an API platform for building and using APIs. It simplifies each step of the API lifecycle and streamlines collaboration, enabling the creation of better APIs faster. Postman is widely used for testing, documenting, and debugging APIs. With Postman, you can send custom HTTP requests and visualize responses, facilitating development and API integration.

Feel free to explore and use these tools in your own development environment. If you have any questions or need assistance, don't hesitate to reach out. Happy coding!
